# âš¡ Distillery Coding Challenge 

This Challenge was performed and worked by [Gustavo Malamud](https://www.gustavomalamud.com)

## DoD

> We provided some simple React template code. Your goal is to create a simple form at the top that allows the user to enter in a first name, last name, and phone number and there should be a submit button. Once the submit button is pressed, the information should be displayed in a list below (automatically sorted by last name) along with all the previous information that was entered. This way the application can function as a simple phone book. When your application loads, the input fields (not the phone book list) should be prepopulated with the following values already:

> First name = Coder
> Last name = Byte
> Phone = 8885559999

> You are free to add classes and styles, but make sure you leave the element ID's as they are. Submit your code once it is complete and our system will validate your output.

## Technologies used

This task was done with a Create React-App application, with Hooks (useState in particular) and with its original styles in CSS-in-JS.
Additional styles were provided through TailwindCSS.
